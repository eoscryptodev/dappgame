```
This boilerplate uses Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Angular 8 + several working services from The Dapp Network + a whole host of other goodies to get your EOSIO game development up and running faster than ever.

Start the Zeus IDE with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/eoscryptodev/dappgame)


After your enviroment finishes loading in the editor, you can try:
```bash
zeus create contract mycontract
# edit your contract under dapp/contracts/eos/mycontract
zeus test
```
This is the new dApp created by the Liquid Dream Team!
